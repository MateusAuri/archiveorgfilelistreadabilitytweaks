# archive.org file list readability tweaks
Userstyle with a few simple tweaks to improve readability on archive.org file download lists.

Install it from https://userstyles.world/style/12533/archive-org-file-list-readability-tweaks (requires [Stylus extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/blob/master/README.md))

## Features:
- **Full width table container**, so now you'll only need to scroll horizontally when there's a long filename in the list;
- **Added left padding to filename**, to make selecting text with a mouse easier;
- **Aligned filesizes to the right**, for a better visual notion of numerical magnitude and comparison between lines;
- **Alternate row colors**, for better line tracking when reading info.

This is my first userstyle ever made/published, please don't mind if there's any wonkiness.
